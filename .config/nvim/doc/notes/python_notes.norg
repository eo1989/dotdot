- Iteration is a general term for taking each item of something, one after another.
  Anytime using a loop, explicit or implicit, to go over a group of items is an iteration.
-- Python iterator example:
@code python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

@end
@code python
num = [1, 2, 3]
for i in num:
    print(i)
@end
